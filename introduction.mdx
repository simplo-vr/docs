# What is SimploVR?

SimploVR is a cheap virtual reality headset that provides a incredible VR experience for users. It brings 6-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) tracking, controllers, and compatibility with SteamVR, enabling users to interact with virtual environments in the best possible way.

What makes SimploVR stand out is that it's a community-driven project created by VR enthusiasts, for VR enthusiasts. We worked hard to refine the hardware and software to provide a high-quality experience while keeping the price low.

Before being a open-non-fiancial, SimploVR was an [hackclub winter hardware](https://hackclub.com/winter) project. We only had $345 dollars to develop all the stuff we needed. So we are not only flexing a cheap headset, it is a cheap headset. The actual estimative of price is $60 dollars.

# Features

SimploVR was made to be an affordable VR headset that provides an immersive experience without breaking the bank. We work hardly to continually improve the technology and user experience. We want it to be the perfect way to explore virtual reality without paying a fortune.

## 6-DOF

SimploVR uses a 6-dof IMU to calculates the position and rotation of your head on the 3D enviroment. Positional tracking with IMU is a pretty dark theme and theres not to much people that used or developed it before. But we made sure to use and improve that. Cause it's the cheapest way to do it.

## SteamVR Support

Most of the vr games are disponible on steam throug a library called steamvr. it's one of the easiest ways to play virtual reality games on pc. Our headset is almost fully compatible with his games library.

## Controllers

SimploVR has proprietary controllers designed to be easy to use and comfortable. Fully 3D-Printed and made with the same IMU as the headset. To make the work easier and lower for price.

## Full-Body-Tracking

<Warning>
  This feature is fully experimental and may not be very accurate or even work...
</Warning>

Using SimploDock (under developement) and SimploVR software you can add full-body tracking to your game (if supported). Pretty experimental and made sidely from simplo.

## Hand Tracking

<Warning>
  This feature is fully experimental and may not be very accurate or even work...
</Warning>

SimploVR uses a simple SimploCam and mediapipe data to track your hands. Not very precise but works pretty well and can do the main work (track the hands and fingers) nicely.
